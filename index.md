### Cellxercise Machine (Biomechanical Culture Reactor)  
[Project Website](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/mae156b-2025spring-team02/home)

**Challenge**: Commercial bioreactor systems often lack the ability to apply both tension and compression in a controlled, incubator-compatible, and modular format, limiting research on musculoskeletal tissue regeneration.

**Solution**:
- Designed a dual-mode actuator system using a SMAC LCA50 capable of delivering cyclic loads up to 20 N at 1 Hz
- Implemented real-time feedback via a load cell and LabVIEW-based control system
- Developed modular clamps for tension and compression that are reusable and sterilizable
- Ensured incubator compatibility, easy disassembly, and high force precision through rigorous design iteration and testing

**Result**:
- Achieved over 90% strain recovery and high fatigue resistance across 6,000 cycles
- Delivered improved usability and force accuracy compared to commercial systems such as ShellPa Pro

### Boomerang Aerodynamics Research

**Challenge**: Investigate how boomerang joint angles impact flight stability and aerodynamic performance.

**Solution**:
- Conducted over 60 field tests with boomerangs of varying joint angles (60°, 90°, 105°, 120°) using UWB positioning
- Simulated airflow and torque in MATLAB to evaluate lift and spin behavior
- Analyzed angular velocity and orientation changes through video-based frame analysis

**Result**:
- Findings contributed to an AIAA paper on wingtip deflection and aerodynamic consistency
- Identified optimal geometries for rotational stability and efficient lift generation

### Robotic Lift Mechanism

**Challenge**: Design a mobile robot to transport weighted blocks between platforms at various elevations with limited mechanical footprint.

**Solution**:
- Designed a compact 4-bar linkage lifting mechanism with a 1:4 torque-enhancing gear train
- Incorporated a claw gripper and traction-based drivetrain
- Modeled all components in SolidWorks and built the frame using laser-cut materials

**Result**:
- Increased payload capacity by 30% compared to the baseline design
- Completed all competition challenges reliably with consistent mechanical performance
