**About Me**  
I'm a mechanical engineer passionate about robotics, automation, and control systems. With hands-on experience at Trane Technologies and research labs at UC San Diego, I've led efforts in robotic integration, workflow optimization, and precision biomechanical system design. I thrive at the intersection of mechanical design, embedded systems, and human-centered engineering.

## 🔬 Selected Projects

---

### 🧬 Cellxercise Machine (Biomechanical Culture Reactor)

Musculoskeletal injuries require lab-based mechanical stimulation for tissue regeneration. Our system advances tissue engineering by applying both cyclic tension and compression inside a sterilizable, incubator-safe environment.

- Dual-mode mechanical loading (up to 20N at 1Hz)  
- Real-time force feedback, LabVIEW control, reusable modular clamps  
- Improved over commercial systems like ShellPa Pro

### 🚗 Autonomous Vehicle Robot

Built a fully functioning autonomous vehicle from scratch.

- Lane detection with OpenCV, GPS, and LiDAR  
- Integrated ChatGPT for dynamic path generation  
- ROS2-based, using Jetson Nano, DonkeyCar, OakD, and Point One GPS

### 🤖 Robotic Lift Mechanism

Designed and built a competitive robot to transport blocks across simulated floors.

- Integrated claw, four-bar linkage, and drivetrain  
- Double torque gear system (1:4) increased lift capacity by 30%  
- Prototyped with SolidWorks and laser cutting

### 🧪 Xtreme Materials Lab (UCSD)

Synthesized novel materials via solvothermal techniques.

- Glove box preparation, inert mixing of carbon-lithium precursors  
- Centrifugation, ultrasonic treatment, and acid washing to ensure purity  
- Focus on extreme environment material integrity
