## About Me

I'm a mechanical engineer passionate about robotics, automation, and control systems. With hands-on experience at Trane Technologies and research labs at UC San Diego, I've led efforts in robotic integration, workflow optimization, and precision biomechanical system design. I thrive at the intersection of mechanical design, embedded systems, and human-centered engineering.

## Selected Projects

### 🧬 Cellxercise Machine (Biomechanical Culture Reactor)
Musculoskeletal injuries require lab-based mechanical stimulation for tissue regeneration. Our system advances tissue engineering by applying both cyclic tension and compression inside a sterilizable, incubator-safe environment.

- Dual-mode mechanical loading (up to 20N at 1Hz)  
- Real-time force feedback, LabVIEW control, reusable modular clamps  
- Improved over commercial systems like ShellPa Pro

### 🚗 Autonomous Vehicle Robot
Built a fully functioning autonomous vehicle from scratch.

- Lane detection with OpenCV, GPS, and LiDAR  
- Integrated ChatGPT for dynamic path generation  
- ROS2-based, using Jetson Nano, DonkeyCar, OakD, and Point One GPS

### 🌀 Boomerang Aerodynamics Study
Focused on the aerodynamics of boomerang flight.

- Oversaw Ultra-Wideband (UWB) experiments to track boomerang trajectories, contributing data for an AIAA paper on wing tip deflection  
- Integrated experimental data into MATLAB for airflow simulations  
- Carried out 15 field trials under various joint angles and low wind conditions

### 🤖 Robotic Lift Mechanism
Designed and built a competitive robot to transport blocks across simulated dorm floors.

- Integrated claw, four-bar linkage, and drivetrain  
- Double torque gear system with 1:4 ratio increased lift capacity by 30%  
- Simulated and prototyped with SolidWorks and laser cutting

### 🧪 Xtreme Materials Lab (UCSD)
Conducted a series of precise procedures for the synthesis of materials using solvothermal techniques.

- Utilized glove box for inert environment preparation  
- Precursors included carbon and lithium compounds, followed by controlled heating  
- Final material purification through centrifugation, acid-washing, and ultrasonic treatment
