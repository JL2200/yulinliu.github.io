### About Me

I'm a mechanical engineer passionate about robotics, automation, and control systems. With hands-on experience at Trane Technologies and research labs at UC San Diego, I've led efforts in robotic integration, workflow optimization, and precision biomechanical system design. I thrive at the intersection of mechanical design, embedded systems, and human-centered engineering.
