## 📁 Projects

### 🧬 Cellxercise Machine (Biomechanical Culture Reactor)
Musculoskeletal injuries require lab-based mechanical stimulation for tissue regeneration. Our system advances tissue engineering by applying both cyclic tension and compression inside a sterilizable, incubator-safe environment.

- Dual-mode mechanical loading (up to 20N at 1Hz)
- Real-time force feedback, LabVIEW control, reusable modular clamps
- Improved over commercial systems like ShellPa Pro

### 🚗 Autonomous Vehicle Robot
Built a fully functioning autonomous vehicle from scratch.

- Lane detection with OpenCV, GPS, and LiDAR
- Integrated ChatGPT for dynamic path generation
- ROS2-based, using Jetson Nano, DonkeyCar, OakD, and Point One GPS

### 🌀 Boomerang Aerodynamics Study
Led experiments and simulations on boomerang joint angles and flight stability.

- Conducted UWB-based field tests with MATLAB airflow simulations
- Data used for AIAA paper on wingtip deflection and orientation performance

### 🤖 Robotic Lift Mechanism
Designed and built a competitive robot to transport blocks across simulated floors.

- Integrated claw, four-bar linkage, and drivetrain
- Double torque gear system with 1:4 ratio increased lift capacity by 30%
- Simulated and prototyped with SolidWorks and laser cutting

### 🧪 Xtreme Materials Lab (UCSD)
Synthesized novel materials via solvothermal techniques.

- Glove box preparation, inert mixing of carbon-lithium precursors
- Centrifugation, ultrasonic treatment, and acid washing to ensure purity
- Focus on extreme environment material integrity
